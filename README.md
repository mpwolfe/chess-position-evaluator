Programs written in Gambit-C Scheme 4.6.7 under Linux

This project is a work in progress.

The idea is to read and process a legal .pgn chess file
and allow the user to interact with the position making white
or black moves, evaluating the position after the moves
have been made.

more to come later.

the series of scheme programs will check that all moves are legal 
chess moves. these programs could also be the foundation for a chess engine
as all chess engines have to make sure that generated moves by the
computer and human are legal and the board postion is updated correctly
after each move.
